Pseudo-Class Selector:- Pseudo means false.

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

The syntax of pseudo-classes:

selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
Example
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}
