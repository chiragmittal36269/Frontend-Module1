Tag Selector:- It is used to select all similar type of tag element and give it the style written in it.

Ex:- p tag, h1 tag, h2 tag etc.
In this all p tag has the same style until a class or id is used. The things is happen with h1 and h2 tag and other tags also.

like:-
p{
    color: blue;
}
h1{
    color: orange;
}

here all p tag have color blue and all h1 tag have color orange. and if we write other tags then it follow the styles.

we can write styles using internal and external way. So, we implement in both the way.
