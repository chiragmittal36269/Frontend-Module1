Class selector:- It selects html element with the use of specific class attribute.
we write the class by using '.' symbol and we use it using class="nameOfClass"
it can also be internal and external.

ex:- .first is the name of class and when we use it then we write class="first"

.first{
    color: yellow;
}
.second{
    color: violet;
}
