Adjacent Sibling Selector:- it targets the immediate next sibling of the given one.
It does not target all the siblings as like in general sibling Selector.
it is used with the help of '+' symbol.

ex:-
this will select the immediate next p tag comes after h1 tag.
if their is any other tag present in between h1 and p tag 
then color of p tag is not changed because p tag is not the immediate tag after h1 tag.
h1 + p{
    color: orange;
}


h1 + h2{
    font-family: 'segoe print';
}
this will impact the immediate h2 tag which is next to h1 tag. not the other h2 tag which comes after h2 tag.

here we also do the things with class and id.

like:-

p + .class{

}

p + #id{

}

.class + p{

}

#id + p{

}

.class + #id{

}

#id + .class{

}
