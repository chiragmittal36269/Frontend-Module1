<!-- paragraph1 and paragraph8 are not the child of div tag so not taken into consideration.
heading1 is not considered because we are not using 'div h1{}' -->

<!-- paragraph5 is the great grand child of div but it also considered because div is the descendant of paragraph5 also. -->

<!-- but in case of child selector paragraph3,paragraph5,paragraph6 is also not considered because these are not the direct child of div tag. -->
