Child Selector:- it select all the particular type of child tag of that tag. 
but it will not work for the grand child. it only work for the direct child.
it is used with the help of '>' symbol.

ex:-
h1 > p{

}
if p is the child of h1 tag then it will give all the style to that p tag.
if there are many p tags and all are the direct child of h1 tag then the style is provided to all of them.

here we also do the things with class and id.

like:-

p > .class{

}

p > #id{

}

.class > p{

}

#id > p{

}

.class > #id{

}

#id > .class{

}
