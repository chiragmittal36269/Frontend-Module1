Internal CSS:- when the style is written in head tag and we are using it directly or with the help of class and id.

<style>
        p{
            color: pink;
        }
        .one{
            color: yellow;
        }
        #two{
            color: orange;
        }
</style>

this style is written in head tag.

p{} this is applicable directly for all the paragraphs. ex:- p tag, h1 tag, g2 tag etc.

.nameOfAny is a class which is used when we write class="one"

#nameOfAny is a id which is used when we write id="two"

it is like:-
selector{
Property:value;
}
Ex;-
p{
    color: pink;
 }
here p is a selector.
