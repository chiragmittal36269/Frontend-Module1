External CSS:- It is using the .css file in which all the styles is written and we are using link tag in head tag to use that .css file.
like:- 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

We write all the styles in the style.css file and after that we can use it using link so that it can work as an internal CSS.
